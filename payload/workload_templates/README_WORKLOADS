SPARTA Workload Information
===========================

This directory contains some pre-configured template files that may be dropped into the SPARTA
configuration directory (/perflogs/etc) as the .commands_local file, which overrides the default
settings in the sparta.config file.

This is to save time when there are certain types of data collection that is required, eg:
the appliance may be overworked and you need a "light" sample of data.


Usage
=====

If you wish to use of these templates, do the following (assumes default location of SPARTA
config directory):

1) Stop SPARTA

   # /perflogs/scripts/sparta.sh stop

2) Deploy the new template

   # cd /perflogs/etc
   # mv .commands_local .commands_local.orig
   # cp ../workload_templates/<template_name> .commands_local

3) Restart SPARTA

   # /perflogs/scripts/sparta.sh start


Supplied Templates

-----
The following are disabled because they can cause additional CPU load/locking contention on an
already busy appliance:

  o) ZFS transaction group monitoring
  o) ZFS metaslab monitoring
  o) ZFS ZIL monitoring
  o) lockstat data collection
  o) NFS, CIFS and iSCSI data dtrace scripts 
     - NFS config data still collected
